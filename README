This repository contains C implementations of the following
finite Galois Fields:

   GF(2^16)
   GF(2^32)
   GF(2^64)

It also contains partial Cryptol specifications of these
implementations.

GF(2^16) is implemented via explicity lookup tables for the
exponential and discrete logarithm functions.  The other
two implementations arise as finite field extensions of
GF(2^16).

Field multiplication in GF(2^32) and GF(2^64) is
straightforward polynomial multiplication followed
by polynomial reduction, albeit hand-tuned to reduce
the number of table lookups.  The calculation of
multiplicative inverses uses the Itoh-Tsujii method,
which can be made fairly fast; and is branching-free,
unlike methods based on Euclidean division.

All algorithms are _branch-free_ and _constant-time_,
if we assume that access to the lookup tables are
constant time (a large and untrue assumption, but probably
reliable enough under nonadversarial conditions).

I mostly put these implementations together for my own
amusement and edification, but perhaps they could be
useful for something eventually.
